# ADR-001: Separation of Concerns between MsgServer and Keeper 

## Introduction

In developing Nibiru Chain, built on Cosmos SDK, we have identified design and
development practices that require optimization. This document proposes
methodologies to differentiate between `MsgServer` and `Keeper` in the code and
to improve our action-based testing framework.

## Changelog

- 2022-06-01: Proposed in [NibiruChain/nibiru
  #524](https://github.com/NibiruChain/nibiru/issues/524) by @testinginprod.
- 2023-12-28: Formal ADR drafted and accepted.

## Context

Merging MsgServer and Keeper goes against separation of responsibilities
principles in Cosmos SDK:

- Obscures distinct functions each component should perform
- Complicates code maintenance due to intertwined responsibilities
- Can lead to security vulnerabilities without clear boundaries

The `MsgServer` should focus on request validation while Keeper handles business logic, like a web app's controller and model respectively.

## Decision

This ADR proposes that we separate MsgServer (validation) from Keeper (business
logic).

For example, Some `MsgServer` methods are restricted to the `x/sudo` group,
showing the need for distinct validation and execution.

## Benefits
Significantly simplifies and improves our action-based testing framework:

Removes need to prepare complex permission schemes
Reduces boilerplate code in tests
Allows focusing purely on business logic
Concerns
Exposing Keeper methods could enable unauthorized access. However, access control is the MsgServerâ€™s responsibility. Keeper maintains state consistency.

Best practice is keeping sensitive methods private, not building permission schemes in Keeper. This aligns with separation of responsibilities.

Conclusion
Separation significantly improves code clarity, maintenance and security - aligning with industry best practices.



## Cosmos SDK: `MsgServer` and `Keeper`

### Issues with Combining `MsgServer` and `Keeper`

Merging `MsgServer` and `Keeper` in the Cosmos SDK context goes against the
fundamental principle of separation of responsibilities. This blending results
in:

- **Role Confusion:** It obscures the distinct functions that each component
  should ideally perform. `MsgServer` should focus on request validation,
  including Permissions, while `Keeper` should handle business logic.
- **Maintenance Challenges:** This conflation complicates code maintenance, as
  intertwined responsibilities make it difficult to isolate and address issues
  effectively.
- **Security Implications:** The lack of clear boundaries between validation and
  execution can lead to security vulnerabilities, as ensuring that each layer
  only handles its intended tasks becomes challenging.

### Analogy with Web Applications

Compared with a web application, the `MsgServer` would act as a controller to
validate requests, while the `Keeper` would be equivalent to business logic or
the model.

## Specific Case in Nibiru Chain

Some `MsgServer` methods in the Nibiru Chain are restricted to the `Sudo` group,
underscoring the need for a clear separation in the validation and execution of
requests.

### Proposal for Functional Separation

We propose that the `MsgServer` solely handles validation while the `Keeper`
manages the business logic post-validation.

## Benefits of the Refactor in the Action-Based Testing Framework

With the proposed restructuring of `MsgServer` and `Keeper`, we gain significant
benefits in our approach to testing, particularly within our action-based testing
framework:

### Simplification of Action-Based Tests

The clear separation of responsibilities between `MsgServer` and `Keeper` allows
our tests to focus on creating atomic actions without setting up complex
scenarios. This eliminates the need for:

- **Preparing Users and Permissions:** There's no longer a requirement to create
  a user and add it to the `Sudo` group for each test scenario, greatly
  simplifying the test setup process.

- **Reducing Boilerplate in Tests:** We minimize additional code required to
  establish preconditions not directly related to the test's objective.

- **Focus on Business Logic:** Tests can concentrate on assessing pure business
  logic, undistracted by security and permission configurations.

## Addressing Potential Concerns: Security and Accessibility of Keeper Methods

### Concerns About Security and Access Control

Some might argue that sharing Keeper's methods can lead to security risks, mainly
if there are concerns about unauthorized access. This viewpoint stems from the
belief that the `Keeper` should control access, which might lead to apprehensions
about exposing specific methods.

### Clarifying the Role of the Keeper

However, this perspective needs to be revised in the fundamental role of the
`Keeper`. The primary responsibility of the `Keeper` is to maintain a consistent
state within the application rather than controlling access. Access control and
validation of requests are the responsibilities of the `MsgServer`, which acts as
the first line of defense.

### Best Practices in Method Exposure

Suppose there's a need to share the Keeper with other modules, and concerns arise
about the safety of exposing specific methods. In that case, the preferred
approach is to keep those sensitive methods private. Implementing access and
permission layers within the `Keeper` goes against the principle of separation of
responsibilities and can lead to a more cohesive and secure system. Instead,
ensuring that only the appropriate methods are exposed and keeping others private
aligns with the philosophy of keeping each component focused on its specific
role.

## Conclusion

Separating the `MsgServer` and `Keeper` in developing and testing the Nibiru
Chain will significantly improve the code's clarity, maintenance, and security.
These improvements reflect our commitment to efficient and robust development,
aligned with the best industry practices.
